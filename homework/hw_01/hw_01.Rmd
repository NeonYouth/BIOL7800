## Introduction

#### My name is Nevyn, and I'm a first-year PhD student in Arthur Porto's lab. There we're currently building a deep-learning model to classify images of bryozoan colonies according to genus. Arthur recommended that I take this course early, as it is intended to kick-off a branch of data science courses that will be offered in the coming years. I finished my undergrad with a degree in Computer Science and Biology, but I primarily work with Java and Python, so I'm hoping to improve my skills with R through this course. Since the core of my work is in machine/deep learning, I am most interested in this application of data science. 


```{bash}
git version
R --version
```
